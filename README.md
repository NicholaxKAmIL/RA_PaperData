### Introduction
This study presents a two-stage deep learningâ€“based approach designed to automate joint localization and damage classification in hand X-rays of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
We developed an innovative two-stage method in which the You Only Look Once v7 (YOLOv7) model is employed for joint localization. This stage incorporates performance enhancements through window-level transformation and the Distance Intersection over Union (DIoU) algorithm. For the second stage, joint damage classification is addressed using a modified EfficientNetV2 model integrated with an attention mechanism to effectively manage data imbalance.
